Hopfield neural networks offer potential advantages such as the possibility of working with uncertain data, learning and flexibility. Hopfield Neural Networks Algorithms were compared to popular non-neural algorithms such as Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall each of the latter presenting protocols such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). Under appropriate assumptions the packet-switched communication networks may also be considered as a shortest path problem and an optimization problem. This optimization problem and shortest path problem can be solved using a Hopfield Neural Networks as a solution. The applied Hopfield Neural Network algorithms were designed to simulate and find the optimal path within a network considering link metrics representing the number of hops, the speed of the path, and packet loss on the link, latency, path reliability, path bandwidth, throughput and load. The applicability of such simulation is shown through various computer simulations which include various link costs and different topologies which include routers (nodes) with bi-directional traffic capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\n\r\nEntity Email: bernard.montebello@mcast.edu.mt\r\n\r\nEmail: bernard.montebello@gmail.com\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bmontebello\r\n\r\nResearch Gate Profile: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernard_Montebello?ev=hdr_xprf\r\n\r\nLinkIn Profile: mt.linkedin.com/pub/bernard-montebello/61/b43/137/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
